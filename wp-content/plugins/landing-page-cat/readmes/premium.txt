= Why Use Landing Page Cat? =
A landing page is a dedicated page on your website that is built from the ground up to convert your visitors into email subscribers, or get them to take any other action you want.

There are a ton of powerful page builder tools out there, but if you need a simple, no-frills landing page you can set up in minutes, you don’t want to waste the time and money on features you’re never going to use.

Landing Page Cat is a simple tool for site builders who want to create a landing page in less than 2 minutes.

Landing pages are particularly effective in the following cases:

* “Coming Soon” pages. If your site isn’t quite ready to launch yet, set up a placeholder landing page with an email optin, so you can notify people when it’s live.
* Maintenance or “under construction” pages. Let people know when a page is under construction, and redirect them to another page or collect their email to notify them later.
* Guest posts. Link your byline link to a landing page in order to convert the maximum number of readers into subscribers.
* Facebook advertising. Drive traffic from Facebook to your landing page to convert them into leads.
* Driving landing page traffic from your blog or sidebar. You could include links or banners in your blog posts or sidebar to drive traffic to your landing page.
* Your homepage. Turn your homepage into a landing page. Perfect when you need a website for your business, but you don’t want to go through the hassle of building a whole site.

Landing pages are powerful tools used by experienced marketers to grow your business. Few tools let you build a landing page as quickly and as easily as Landing Page Cat.
